    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>Belgian fries are cooked twice for a soft middle and crisp outside and served with a mayo sauce called 'Andalouse' that can be best described as vaguely similar to Thousand Island dressing. The sauce makes a great chip dip or vegetable dip as well. We go through so much of it, I double it! My husband's family is Belgian, Flemish to be exact. I am told Flemish is equated with quality. This is a snack that is worth the time and effort! Since this is all about quality, be sure to use firm, fresh potatoes. Bring the sauce to room temperature before serving.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup mayonnaise </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced red onion</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced green bell pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced red bell pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>Â¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3 pounds russet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/4-inch strips</li>
        <li>4 cups olive oil for frying, or as needed</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir mayonnaise, tomato paste, red onion, green bell pepper, red bell pepper, lemon juice, and salt together in a bowl. Cover the Andalouse sauce with plastic wrap and refrigerate 8 hours to overnight.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Submerge potato strips in a bowl of ice water; rinse potatoes in several changes of cold water until water in the bowl is clear. Drain potatoes and pat dry.</li>
        <li>Working in batches, fry potatoes in the hot oil until just cooked through but still white, about 5 minutes. Transfer fries to a paper-towel lined plate to drain. Bring oil back to temperature between batches. Cool potatoes to room temperature, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Increase oil temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Working in batches, fry the potatoes again until deep golden, 5 to 10 minutes more. Transfer fries to a paper-towel lined plate to drain. Season fries with salt and serve with Andalouse sauce.</li>
    </ol>
